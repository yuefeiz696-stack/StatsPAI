# JOSS Validation Dossier

This dossier collects reviewer-facing evidence for StatsPAI's readiness as
research software. It is intentionally factual and reproducible.

## Project Status

- Repository: <https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/StatsPAI>
- Package archive: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19933900>
- PyPI: <https://pypi.org/project/StatsPAI/>
- License: MIT, with a plain-text `LICENSE` file in the repository.
- Current release at the time of this dossier: `1.16.0`, released on
  2026-05-29.
- Public GitHub repository creation date: 2025-07-26.
- Public repository activity signals as of 2026-05-29: 210 stars, 37 forks,
  23 GitHub releases, and 1 public external user issue in addition to
  maintainer-created issue/PR activity.

## Software Scope

StatsPAI exposes a unified Python interface for causal inference and applied
econometrics. As of release `1.16.0`, the registry reports 1,018 public
functions across 80 submodules:

```bash
python scripts/registry_stats.py --check
```

The registry and schema layer are part of the public surface. They support
programmatic discovery through `sp.list_functions()`, `sp.describe_function()`,
and `sp.function_schema()`.

## Validation Assets

The repository includes several independent validation tracks:

- Unit and integration tests across the main estimator families.
- R parity modules under `tests/r_parity/`.
- Stata parity modules under `tests/stata_parity/`.
- Reference-parity checks under `tests/reference_parity/`.
- Original-paper replay fixtures under `tests/orig_parity/`.
- Monte Carlo coverage checks under `tests/coverage_monte_carlo/`.
- Snapshot tests for publication-table output under `tests/output_snapshots/`.
- Citation and bibliography audits under `tools/`.
- Reviewer-facing offline examples under `examples/`.

The maintained local full-suite report records:

```text
5200 passed, 98 skipped, 13 deselected, 1 xfailed, 2 xpassed
```

on Python 3.9.6 for the default local suite as of 2026-05-17. The exact report
is stored in `test_results_full_suite.md`.

## Parity And Replication Anchors

StatsPAI includes validation fixtures for common teaching and replication
benchmarks, including:

- Card-style returns-to-schooling IV estimates.
- LaLonde / Dehejia-Wahba job-training benchmarks.
- Lee-style close-election regression discontinuity.
- Callaway-Sant'Anna difference-in-differences examples.
- California Proposition 99 synthetic-control examples.

Known convention differences are documented in parity reports rather than
hidden. For example, bandwidth selectors, regularisation constants, small-sample
standard-error conventions, and fold-split randomness are recorded in the
R-parity report where they affect exact numerical matching.

## Research Use

At submission time, StatsPAI is being used in working-paper workflows connected
to the Stanford Rural Education Action Program and related empirical policy
evaluation work. No peer-reviewed research article using StatsPAI has yet been
published. The current impact claim is therefore based on credible near-term
research use, reproducible validation materials, public package distribution,
and reviewer-verifiable examples rather than published downstream citations.

## Public Distribution And Community Signals

StatsPAI is publicly distributed on PyPI and archived on Zenodo. The GitHub
repository has public stars, forks, issue templates, discussions links,
contribution instructions, support instructions, release notes, and CI status
checks. These are treated as community-readiness and public-interest signals,
not as evidence of independent scholarly adoption.

The public fork list is available through GitHub at
<https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/StatsPAI/forks>. As of 2026-05-29, the
GitHub API reported 37 forks, all owned by normal GitHub `User` accounts. The
project does not infer downstream research use from those forks unless a user
opens an issue, pull request, citation, or reproducible report that documents
such use.

## Commercial Downstream Disclosure

StatsPAI Inc. is the legal entity associated with the project. CoPaper.AI is a
commercial downstream product that may call the MIT-licensed StatsPAI package.
The StatsPAI package itself is permanently open source under the MIT license.
This is an open-core / commercial-downstream arrangement: the research software
submitted to JOSS remains open, while commercial products can build on it under
the same license terms available to all users.

## Reproducible Checks

From a repository checkout:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,plotting]"
python -m pytest tests/test_ols.py tests/test_did.py tests/test_registry.py -q --no-cov
python scripts/registry_stats.py --check
python scripts/schema_quality.py
python tools/audit_bib_duplicates.py --strict
python tools/audit_bib_coverage.py --strict-dangling --hide-orphans
python -m build
python -m twine check dist/*
```

`docs/joss_reviewer_guide.md`.
