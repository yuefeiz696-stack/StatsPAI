"""Curated Tier-A agent-native metadata overlay (machine-generated input,
human-verified content).

Generated for the v1.16 agent-native sprint to lift assumptions /
failure_modes / alternatives / typical_n_min coverage across the
certified + validated tier.  Same extend-missing semantics as
``registry._AGENT_CARD_SEED_METADATA`` (curated specs in registry.py
always win); applied by ``registry._apply_agent_card_seeds``.

Every ``alternative`` here was validated to resolve to a real registered
function / sp attribute / MCP tool, and every ``exception`` to a real
exception class, by the same checks as
``tests/test_agent_native_contract.py``.  Do not hand-edit dangling
pointers in; run the contract suite after changes.
