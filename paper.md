# Summary

`StatsPAI` is an open-source Python package for causal inference and
applied econometrics. It gives empirical researchers a single interface
for estimating, diagnosing, comparing, and reporting models that are
usually spread across many specialized packages or proprietary
statistical environments. The package currently exposes more than 1,000
registered functions across 81 submodules, covering classical
regression, instrumental variable analysis, panel data, difference-in-differences,
regression discontinuity, synthetic control, matching,
stochastic frontier analysis, mixed-effects models, decomposition
methods, sensitivity analysis, and modern machine-learning estimators
for heterogeneous treatment effects.

The package is designed for policy evaluation, social science and
public health research, and other empirical workflows where researchers
must move between research design, estimation, diagnostics, robustness
checks, and publication tables. Mature estimator results expose common
reporting hooks such as `.summary()`, `.plot()`, `.to_latex()`,
`.to_docx()`, and `.cite()` where those capabilities are implemented;
auxiliary helpers advertise narrower capabilities through registry
metadata. `StatsPAI` is also agent-native: registered functions
expose machine-readable schemas (structured descriptions of each
function's arguments and outputs that programs can parse directly) and
structured failure metadata so that LLM-driven research assistants can
discover estimators, choose among alternatives, and surface assumptions
without parsing free-form prose.

# Statement of Need

Applied researchers face a fragmented software landscape. Stata offers
an integrated workflow, but it is proprietary and does not expose a
typed, machine-readable interface for AI-assisted analysis. R provides
excellent method-specific packages such as `did`, `rdrobust`, `Synth`,
`grf`, and `lme4`, but these packages use different APIs, object
systems, output conventions, and diagnostic workflows
[@callaway2021difference; @calonico2014robust; @abadie2010synthetic;
@wager2018estimation; @bates2015lme4]. Python has strong pieces of the
causal inference ecosystem, including `DoWhy` for graphical causal
models [@sharma2020dowhy], `EconML` for machine-learning treatment
effect estimation [@econml], `CausalML` for uplift modeling
[@chen2020causalml], and `DoubleML` for double/debiased machine
learning [@bach2022doubleml]. None of these tools, however, is intended
to cover the full applied-econometrics workflow from design diagnosis
through estimation, robustness, and publication output.

`StatsPAI` addresses this gap for graduate students, applied
economists, policy researchers, and data scientists who want a
Python-native workflow without giving up the breadth of Stata or the
methodological depth of R. The goal of `StatsPAI` is not to replace every specialized
implementation. Instead, it provides a coherent empirical workspace:
shared formula conventions, compatible result surfaces for mature
estimators, export methods where supported, citations attached to
estimators, and validation metadata that make the relationship between
methods, assumptions, and evidence explicit.

# State of the Field

Existing Python packages are strongest when they focus on a narrower
problem. `DoWhy` emphasizes identification, graphical assumptions, and
refutation; `EconML` and `CausalML` focus on heterogeneous effects and
uplift modeling; `DoubleML` implements orthogonal-score estimators for a
well-defined family of double machine-learning designs. These packages
are complementary to `StatsPAI`, and several ideas in `StatsPAI` follow
the same methodological literature, including double/debiased machine
learning [@chernozhukov2018double], causal forests
[@wager2018estimation], and meta-learners [@kunzel2019metalearners].

The build-versus-contribute case for `StatsPAI` is therefore about
scope and interface rather than a single estimator. Contributing one
more estimator to each existing project would still leave users with
many incompatible result classes, separate diagnostic conventions, and
no unified agent-facing schema. `StatsPAI` contributes an integration
layer with substantive statistical content: broad method coverage,
shared reporting, explicit estimator citations, stable/experimental API
metadata, cross-language parity checks, and an LLM-oriented registry
that can expose statistical tools safely to automated workflows.

# Software Design

`StatsPAI` is organized around method families and a registry layer.
Researchers can call focused functions, such as an IV or
regression-discontinuity estimator, or use higher-level dispatchers that select
among variants within a design family. The registry records function
names, parameters, examples, stability tiers, limitations, citations,
and schema information. This makes the package usable both from a
notebook and from external systems such as a Model Context Protocol
server.

The central design choice is a shared result interface. Estimators
return structured objects that store coefficients, uncertainty
estimates, diagnostics, fitted values, plots, and exporter hooks in
predictable locations. This reduces the switching cost between classical
econometric estimators and modern machine-learning estimators, and it
also makes validation easier because tests can compare common fields
across implementations.

The package is implemented mainly in Python on top of NumPy, SciPy,
Pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn, and linearmodels. This keeps the
installation path familiar for Python users and supports Python 3.9 and
newer versions of Python. Optional accelerator backends are used only
where they materially change the computation: PyTorch for neural causal
estimators, JAX for
selected bootstrap and linear algebra workloads, and a Rust/PyO3 kernel
for high-dimensional fixed-effect and cluster-variance routines. This
keeps the default package inspectable while allowing heavy workloads to
use specialized backends when available. The package is distributed via
PyPI under the MIT license.

# Research Impact Statement

`StatsPAI` ships a concrete validation and community-readiness dossier
built from two complementary tracks. The first is a cross-language
parity harness that checks whether `StatsPAI` reproduces the numerical
output of established R and Stata implementations on identical inputs:
a 51-module R-joined Track A parity table in which `StatsPAI`, R, and
Stata read the same input bytes, of which 43 modules also carry a
frozen Stata sibling (plus one Python-Stata-only `xtabond` migration
check, for 44 frozen Stata modules in total). On closed-form estimators
the three languages agree to machine precision; iterative and
machine-learning estimators agree within pre-registered, documented
tolerances, and the few remaining convention gaps are disclosed rather
than hidden. The second track calibrates the simulated teaching
datasets bundled in `sp.datasets` so that the canonical estimator
recovers values in the neighbourhood of well-known published results:
returns-to-schooling IV (Card), job-training effects
(LaLonde/Dehejia-Wahba), regression-discontinuity elections (Lee),
multi-period difference-in-differences (Callaway-Sant'Anna), and
synthetic control. Because these datasets are simulated rather than the
original study data, exact numerical replication is deliberately not
claimed. The validation suite also includes a 1000-replication coverage
run for representative OLS, difference-in-differences, and
strong-instrument IV designs, with empirical coverage close to the
nominal 95 percent level. A reviewer-facing validation dossier and a
short reviewer guide are included in the repository documentation.

The near-term research impact is a more reproducible empirical workflow
for applied policy evaluation. Because methods share one interface,
researchers can compare estimators on the same data, export tables with
the same metadata, and record the citations and assumptions attached to
each analysis. `StatsPAI` is currently being used in an ongoing working
paper connected to the Rural Education Action Program at Stanford
University, *Family contagion of screen time? Within-person evidence
from six waves in China* (Wang, Zhang, and Hou, in preparation), which
relies on the package for its panel and within-person estimation; no
peer-reviewed research article using the package has yet been
published. The current impact claim is therefore based on active
working-paper use, public distribution, reproducible validation
materials, and reviewer-verifiable examples. The agent-native registry
also supports AI-assisted replication and robustness analysis in which
statistical tools are discovered and invoked through explicit schemas
rather than informal prompts.

# AI Usage Disclosure

Generative AI tools, including Claude Code and OpenAI ChatGPT/Codex,
were used for code-generation assistance, refactoring suggestions, test
scaffolding, documentation drafting, and manuscript copy-editing. Exact
model identifiers were not retained for all exploratory sessions. Human
authors made the core design decisions; reviewed, edited, and checked
AI-assisted code and prose; and checked citations and software claims
against repository evidence. The authors will not use generative AI to
produce substantive responses to journal editors or reviewers. All authors
take responsibility for the correctness, originality, licensing, and
compliance of the package and this paper.
